### Hi there 👋<br>Let me introduce myself...I'm Clayton...a former ESL teacher turned data analyst. 
I took the plunge into the deep end with programming in Python at Ironhack. They taught me everything I know about working in Data. Now, as I look for positions, I am always tending to my projects 🌱 ... And I have a lot of projects in the works...

---------
### What motivated me to make the jump from teaching to programming?
As a teacher, I had clients from different backgrounds and professions. Some were doctors, engineers, bankers, and programmers. When COVID became a pandemic, my classes stopped and I acted quickly to put myself on a more secure professional path. My student suggested that I start with Python and I took their advice. It kept me busy and I found that I could pick it up easily. Problem solving is a creative process and stimulating challenge for me and I was always puzzling with something in my spare time. Now, my passion as a teacher has translated into a passion as a learner and developer.

My objectives are not only to understand what I need to do but to translate those ideas for people from non-digital backgrounds, to provide valuable services to any client regardless of their background. 

---------
### What else for the moment?
I am looking to collaborate on a project...any project, one built on team work and data.
I'm currently learning: 
- Feature Engineering 💎💎💎
- ML models ⚙️ 🤖 ⚙️
- Python design principles 🐍🐍🧩
- Automating tasks ⚙️🛠⛓
- BI and Tableau  📈📊📉
