### Hi there ðŸ‘‹<br>Let me introduce myself...I'm Clayton...a former English teacher. 
I took the plunge into the deep end with programming in Python at Ironhack. They taught me everything I would need to know about working in Data Science. Now, as I look for positions, I keep trimming and pruning my projectsðŸŒ¿. I have a lot of work in progress but I am always moving a piece here and a piece there.
